## **Project background/reason/problem to be solved**

With the explosion of the concept of the metaverse, more and more pioneers have come to this world. If you want to attract users' attention for a long time, you must continue to innovate and make players feel interesting and look forward to it. This is a suggestion for our metaverse game. Strong playability and high scalability requirements. The technology of hardware devices only contributes to a part of the human experience in the metaverse. The other two more important elements are the identity system and the value system. <warp gate>Â confirms the identity system through NFT. From early pioneering to later development, all participants plan independently. Just like the natural evolution of the entire world for thousands of years, <warp gate>Â gives players full degrees of freedom.

We are also thinking, the current metaverse games on the market are still in the early stages, and the experience is very rough. Why are so many people joining them?

We believe that what this group experiences is the presence of creation and co-creation (relationship). The Metaverse gives participants the freedom to unleash their creativity to create worlds, establish rules, and define value.

Friends who have played sandbox games know that there is nothing happier than a new world that you build brick by brick! If you want to say happier, it is to build a new world with your friends! Therefore, we believe that this group of sandbox game fans are naturally the builders of the metaverse and the expanders of new concepts, because they have already had too many experiences of creating worlds.

The presence of creativity and relationships is what attracts Metaverse builders.

It is human nature to position ourselves and think about the world through human interaction. If the Metaverse can use another dimension to allow people to establish more relationships and experience more experiences together, it will meet the needs of this part of humanity. <warp gate> is such a development game. Players make money in the game while developing their beloved village.Kevin Kelly said in the book "Inevitably"; "People will discover new jobs at new levels of productivity." In my opinion, new possibilities, new ways of working, new employment models, are all Possibilities in the Metaverse.
